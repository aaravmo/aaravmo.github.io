			"I'm an undergraduate student, software developer, and machine learning researcher at USC. I have experience designing model architectures, training schemes, and datasets in a variety of ML domains, including image/video processing, signal processing, and natural language. I also have experience writing scalable, high-quality backend code in Python and Java. I'm a quick learner, and I enjoy tackling complex challenges in a variety of domains of software and data science.",
